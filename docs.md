## Different documents for different purposes

![diagram of documents described in the text]({{ "/content-images/wai-intro-wcag/wcag20docs.png" | relative_url }})<br>Figure 1: WCAG 2.0 documents. WCAG 2.1 has the same type of documents.

### WCAG 2

Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2 itself is
designed to be a stable, referenceable technical standard. Most people
will use the supporting documents when developing Web content and Web
tools, instead of the actual technical standards document.

### How to Meet WCAG 2 (Quick Reference)

[How to Meet WCAG 2: A customizable quick reference to WCAG 2
requirements (Success Criteria) and
techniques](http://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG20/quickref/) is a **key resource
for designers and developers using WCAG 2. It includes all the WCAG
2 guidelines and success criteria**. It is essentially the [WCAG 2
checklist](http://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG20/quickref/).

The success criteria are the testable statements that define how Web
content meets (conforms to) WCAG 2. Under each success criteria are a
list of sufficient techniques; that is, if you implement those
techniques you meet the success criteria. It also lists common failures,
that is, things that do not meet the guidelines.

You can customize How to Meet WCAG 2 based on whether you are using
CSS, JavaScript, multimedia, or other Web technologies. You can also
select to show [Level A, AA, or AAA success
criteria](http://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/conformance.html#uc-levels-head).

### Understanding WCAG 2

**"Understanding WCAG 2: A guide to understanding and implementing Web
Content Accessibility Guidelines 2"** ([2.1 Understanding](/@@), [2.0 Understanding](/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/))
has additional details for people who want to understand the guidelines
and success criteria more thoroughly. It provide extensive guidance,
including the intent of the guideline or success criterion; how it helps
people with different disabilities, browser and assistive technology
support notes, examples, and resources, such as [tools to check color
contrast](http://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/visual-audio-contrast-contrast.html#visual-audio-contrast-contrast-resources-head).

### Techniques for WCAG 2

**"Techniques for WCAG 2: Techniques and Failures for Web Content
Accessibility Guidelines 2"** ([2.1 Techniques](/@@), [2.0 Techniques](/TR/WCAG20-TECHS/)) gives specific
guidance for developers on how to develop accessible Web content. It
provides general and technology-specific examples, including for
HTML/XHTML, CSS, scripting, multimedia, and
[WAI-ARIA](http://www.w3.org/WAI/intro/aria). There are also common
failures that show what to avoid.

Getting from one document to the other
--------------------------------------

The WCAG 2 documents are interlinked. For example:

-   In WCAG 2,
    -   Links such as "How to Meet 1.1.1" go to the **How to Meet WCAG
        2** document, and jumps down to that section within the
        document.
    -   Links such as "Understanding 1.1.1" links go to an
        **Understanding WCAG 2** topic page.
        -   You can get to the [Contents list of all the Understanding
            topics](http://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/#contents)
            from the \[Contents\] button at the top.
        -   You can get all the topics in one large Web page from the
            "single HTML version" link in the footer of each topic page.
-   In both How to Meet WCAG 2 and Understanding WCAG 2, there are
    lists of techniques that are links. These links go to a **Techniques
    for WCAG 2** topic page.
    -   You can get to the [Contents list of all the Techniques
        topics](http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20-TECHS/#contents) from the
        \[Contents\] button at the top.
    -   You can get all the topics in one large Web page from the
        "single HTML version" link in the footer of each topic page.
