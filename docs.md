## Different documents for different purposes

![diagram of documents described in the text]({{ "/content-images/wai-intro-wcag/wcag20docs.png" | relative_url }})<br>Figure 1: WCAG 2.0 documents. WCAG 2.1 has the same documents.

### WCAG 2 Standard

Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2 is designed to be a stable, referenceable technical standard. Most people will use the supporting documents when developing web content and web tools, instead of the actual technical standards document.

### How to Meet WCAG 2 (Quick Reference)

[How to Meet WCAG 2 (Quick Reference): A customizable quick reference to WCAG 2 requirements (Success Criteria) and techniques](http://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/) is a **key resource for designers and developers using WCAG 2. It includes all the WCAG 2 guidelines and success criteria**. It is essentially the [WCAG 2 checklist](http://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/).

The success criteria are the testable statements that define how web content meets (conforms to) WCAG 2. Under each success criteria are a list of sufficient techniques; that is, if you implement those techniques you meet the success criteria. It also lists common failures, that is, things that do not meet the guidelines.

You can customize _How to Meet WCAG 2_ to show what you are interested in at the time. There are "filters" for different roles, topics, and technologies (such as HTML, CSS, ARIA). You can also select to show [Level A, AA, or AAA success criteria](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/conformance#levels).

### Understanding WCAG 2

_Understanding WCAG 2: A guide to understanding and implementing Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2_ ([2.1 Understanding](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/), [2.0 Understanding](https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/)) has additional details for people who want to understand the guidelines and success criteria more thoroughly. It provide extensive guidance, including the intent of the guideline or success criterion; how it helps people with different disabilities, browser and assistive technology support notes, examples, and resources, such as [tools to check color contrast](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/contrast-minimum.html#resources).

### Techniques for WCAG 2

_Techniques for WCAG 2: Techniques and Failures for Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2_ ([2.1 Techniques]( https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Techniques/), [2.0 Techniques](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20-TECHS/)) gives specific guidance for developers on how to develop accessible web content. It provides general and technology-specific examples, including for HTML/XHTML, CSS, scripting, multimedia, and [WAI-ARIA](/standards-guidelines/aria/). There are also common failures that show what to avoid.

## Getting from one document to the other

The WCAG 2 documents are interlinked. For example:

-   In WCAG 2,
    -   Links such as "How to Meet 1.1.1" go to the **How to Meet WCAG 2** document, and jumps down to that section within the document.
    -   Links such as "Understanding 1.1.1" links go to an **Understanding WCAG 2** topic page.
        -   You can get to the [Contents list of all the Understanding topics](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/#understanding-pages) from the [Contents] button at the top.
        -   You can get all the topics in one large web page from the "single HTML version" link in the footer of each topic page.
-   In both How to Meet WCAG 2 and Understanding WCAG 2, there are lists of techniques that are links. These links go to a **Techniques for WCAG 2** topic page.
    -   You can get to the [Contents list of all the Techniques topics](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Techniques/#techniques) from the [Contents] button at the top.
    -   You can get all the topics in one large web page from the "single HTML version" link in the footer of each topic page.
