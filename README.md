## Translation Notes for WCAG 2 at a Glance

Please consider the wording in the WCAG 2.2 success criteria. If there is a translation of WCAG 2 in your language, review it thoughtfully. This text is not the same as the success criteria wording &mdash; it is a paraphrased summary that is intended to be easier to understand and accurate - yet it does not need to be comprehensive.

Please collaborate with others who are familiar with WCAG to refine this wording in your language. Thank you!
